# Migrating a FastAPI API to PostgreSQL with Docker: A Comprehensive Guide

Many software projects start with a simple database like SQLite. It's lightweight, requires no server, and is perfect for prototyping and initial development. However, as an application grows, the need for a more robust, scalable, and concurrent database system becomes apparent. PostgreSQL is a fantastic choice for this next step.

In this guide, we'll document the complete journey of migrating a FastAPI API from SQLite to PostgreSQL, all orchestrated with Docker and Docker Compose to create a clean, reproducible, and production-ready development environment.

This series of posts will cover:

*   **Part 1: The Database Migration:** The core steps of switching the database from SQLite to a containerized PostgreSQL instance.
*   **Part 2: Dockerization and Optimization:** How we built and optimized the Docker image for our API using multi-stage builds.
*   **Part 3: Code Quality and Refactoring:** Improving the application's codebase by applying the DRY principle.
*   **Part 4: Production-Ready Logging:** Implementing a robust, structured logging system with dynamic levels and request tracing.
*   **Part 5: Evolving Your Database with Alembic Migrations:** Managing database schema changes systematically with a powerful migration tool.
*   **Part 6: Securing the API with JWT Authentication:** Implementing a modern, secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens.

Follow along as we transform this application step-by-step! To make setup easier, the project includes a `.env.example` file with all the necessary environment variables. Simply copy it to `.env` to get started quickly.
