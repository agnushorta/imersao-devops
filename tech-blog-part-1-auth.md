# Tech Deep Dive Part 1: A Guide to Modern API Authentication

An API running on a local network might feel safe, but true security must be explicit, not implicit. As soon as an application needs to be accessed by different clients or services, we need a reliable way to answer two fundamental questions:

1.  **Authentication:** *Who are you?* (Verifying identity)
2.  **Authorization:** *What are you allowed to do?* (Verifying permissions)

This post explores the common strategies for securing an API and explains why we chose JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with the RS256 algorithm as our gold standard.

### Level 1: API Keys - The Simple Gatekeeper

The most basic form of API security is the **API Key**. It's a long, unique string that a client sends with each request, typically in a header like `X-API-Key`.

-   **Pros:** Simple to implement and easy to revoke access for a specific client.
-   **Cons:** It's like a single password shared among services. If the key leaks, an attacker has full access. It doesn't have an expiration date and isn't ideal for authenticating end-users.
-   **Best For:** Server-to-server communication where the client can securely store the key.

### Level 2: JWT - The Modern Standard for User Sessions

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are the dominant technology for handling user authentication in modern web and mobile applications.

The flow is simple:
1.  A user provides their credentials (e.g., email and password).
2.  The server validates them and issues a **JWT**. This token is a self-contained, digitally signed JSON object with user information and an expiration date.
3.  The client stores this token and sends it in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of every subsequent request.

The key benefit is that the server can verify the token's authenticity just by checking its digital signature, without needing to query the database on every request. This makes the system **stateless** and highly scalable.

### The Crucial Detail: Signing Algorithm (HS256 vs. RS256)

A JWT's security hinges on its signature. There are two main ways to sign a token, and the difference is critical.

#### HS256 (Symmetric): The House Key

With HS256, there is only **one secret key**. The same key is used to *sign* (create) the token and to *verify* it.

-   **Analogy:** It's like the key to your house. The same key locks and unlocks the door.
-   **The Flaw:** Any service that needs to verify a token must also have this secret key. If any of those services are compromised, the attacker steals the key and can now **create new, valid tokens for any user**. This is a massive security risk in a microservices architecture.

#### RS256 (Asymmetric): The Bank Vault

With RS256, we use a **key pair**: a private key and a public key.

-   **The Private Key:** This is the ultimate secret. It is used **only to sign (create) tokens**. It should be protected at all costs and live only on the authentication service.
-   **The Public Key:** This key can only **verify signatures** created by its corresponding private key. It cannot create new tokens.

-   **Analogy:** Think of a bank vault with a deposit slot. Anyone with the public key (the slot) can verify that a deposit is valid, but only the person with the private key can open the vault.
-   **The Advantage:** This provides a huge security improvement. You can distribute the public key freely to all your microservices. If one of them is compromised, the attacker cannot forge new tokens because they don't have the private key.

**Conclusion:** For any application that might grow or use a microservices architecture, **RS256 is the superior and recommended choice.**

### Practical Management: Generating and Storing Your Keys

Generating an RSA key pair is straightforward with the OpenSSL command-line tool.

1.  **Generate the Private Key (The Secret):**
    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    ```

2.  **Extract the Public Key (The Verifier):**
    ```bash
    openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
    ```

#### The Golden Rule of Key Management

**NEVER, EVER commit your `private_key.pem` to version control (Git).**

-   Add `certs/private_key.pem` or even the entire `certs/` directory to your `.gitignore` file.
-   Load the key into your application via environment variables that point to the file path.
-   In a real production environment, you would use a dedicated secret management service like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault to handle the private key securely.

By understanding these concepts, you can build an authentication system that is not only functional but also secure, scalable, and ready for the demands of modern application development.
